# TSFool: Adversarial Time Series Generation Tool based on Weighted Finite Automaton to Fool Recurrent Neural Network Classifiers

July 2022 update: 

- The sample program using TSFool to generate adversarial time series for an LSTM classifier in PowerCons Dataset from UCR Archive is added for reference in advance.

- The work is in progress at present and the detailed description (as well as a possible technology paper) will be opened to the public soon.
